                        Created by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century and originally called “Contrology,” Pilates is a system of exercises designed to enhance the body’s potential by correcting muscular imbalances, finding optimal alignment, and creating efficient movement patterns.
                        
                        Pilates exercises, in conjunction with your breath, employ all of your body’s muscles. It’s known for targeting smaller and deeper stabilization muscles and often explained as working from the inside out.
                        
                        Pilates supports your body’s structure through a balance of strength, mobility, and flexibility, with every exercise engaging your core. It can involve matwork or low impact bodyweight exercises, or it can be done on specialized equipment.</p>
